# Vilya

> *The Ring of Air — mightiest of the Three. The workflow that orchestrates every project.*

Your VSA + SOLID orchestration system — skills, the registry app, the reference
site, and the tracking model, in one repo. Built for **Claude Code + Cursor**,
across **.NET/Blazor and Next.js**.

```

See **HANDOFF.md** for the exact steps to bootstrap this in Claude Code.

## The model

- **Skills are user-level** — install once (`scripts/install-skills.*`) to
  `~/.claude/skills`; Cursor scans that directory as a compatibility root, so
  the same `SKILL.md` runs in both tools from one install. (A second copy in
  `~/.cursor/skills` would double-list skills in Cursor — `--include-cursor`
  exists only for old Cursor builds.)
- **Per-repo config is the only thing that varies** — each project you run the
  loop on gets its own `docs/project-tracking/GITHUB-PROJECTS.md`.
- **The registry app** reads `skills/` as its source of truth (via `SKILLS_DIR`)
  and surfaces each skill's version history from git.

## Deployment

The site + registry deploy to **Railway** as one service from the **repo root**
(the app reads `../../skills` and git history, so the service must not be
scoped to `apps/skill-registry`). Config-as-code: `railway.json` (build/start
commands, healthcheck), `nixpacks.toml` (adds `git` to the image), root
`package.json` (proxy scripts). Live at **https://vilya.jerrodtuck.com**.

## The name

Narya and Anduin are projects; **Vilya** is the ring that rules the process that
builds them. You are its bearer — the orchestrator. The skills are your
instruments; the board is the one shared state; the loop turns.
